== Installation and Setup

1. Create the MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite databases for your Web site. You only
   need to create the "production" database, but you may also want to create
   the "development" and "test" databases if you are developing extensions
   or running tests.

2. Edit config/database.yml to taste.

3. Add "spree" gem to Gemfile

    gem 'spree'

4. Update your bundle

    $ bundle install

5. Use the install generator to do the basic setup. The install generator will prompt you to run migrations, setup some
basic data, and load sample products, orders, etc.

    $ rails g spree:site

To auto accept all prompts while running the install generator, pass -A as an option

  $ rails g spree:site -A

If you chose to ignore the prompts while running the basic install
generator you can manually run migrations and load basic data with the following
commands

    $ bundle exec rake db:migrate
    $ bundle exec rake db:seed

6. To manually load sample products, orders, etc., run the following rake task

    $ bundle exec rake spree_sample:load

7. Start it like a normal Rails application. To test execute:
   
     $ rails server
   
   And open your Web browser on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000). The
   administrative interface is available at /admin/. By default the sample load
   rake task creates a user called "spree@example.com" with a password of "spree123".
