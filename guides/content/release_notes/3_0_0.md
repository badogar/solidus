## Major/New Features

### Bootstrap Backend & Frontend

The most visible change will be the use of Bootstrap to replace the previous
Skeleton framework. We've redesigned the frontend, and backend while keeping
much of the previous structure to the site. We hope this will make upgrades
slightly easier to port to the new Bootstrap markup.  Now that we've updated
the default css/js framework we're hoping to begin implementing usability
improvements & improved mobile support.

### Rails 4.2 Support

We've added Rails 4.2 support laying the groundwork for further improvements.
Rails 4.2 comes with ActiveJob a background job API, which we will leverage in
the future to send long running tasks to Sidekiq, DelayedJob or Resque if you
set them up.  We've also already updated mailers to use the deliver later
functionality so you can send your confirmation emails in the background.

### Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce

With the change to [enhanced ecommerce](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce) tracking you should make sure to [upgrade your Google Analytics account to Universal Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/upgrade/reference/gajs-analyticsjs#overview).  If you use Spree's default google analytics implementation you should be fine, but if you've customized these make sure to update to [Universal Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/).
